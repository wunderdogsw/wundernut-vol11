## Starfleet calls for your help!

We have received a [message](./message.wav), which our computer cannot decipher due to maintenance of its universal translator subroutines. We identified the message to be encoded in [International Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). We need your help to develop a program, which can decode this first message, and also new messages we'll receive in future.

## Specification

* The messages are Microsoft WAV/PCM files similar to [message](./message.wav) (16bit 44.1kHz Mono, `.wav` -filetype)
* Choose any programming language and set of libraries for the task
* The program needs to be able to open the waveform file
* The program must decode any alphanumeric [International Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) characters and punctuation mark (`.`, which is `.-.-.-` in morse)
* Characters must be printed in text format after decoding is complete

## Rules

* Use [submission form](https://www.wunderdog.fi/wundernut) to submit your contribution
* The submission must include full source code and instructions to compile and run the program
* All submissions will be reviewed by a jury, which consists of Wunderdog developers
* Best submission, in terms of general [code quality metrics](https://blog.cloudboost.io/code-quality-metrics-67dc861ac139), will be selected from programs which fulfill the specification
